<!-- Write a JavaScript function which says whether a number is perfect.
ccording to Wikipedia : In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer
that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, that is, the sum of its
positive divisors excluding the number itself (also known as its aliquot sum).
Equivalently, a perfect number is a number that is half the sum of all of its
positive divisors (including itself).
Example : The first perfect number is 6, because 1, 2, and 3 are its proper
positive divisors, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. Equivalently, the number 6 is equal to half the
sum of all its positive divisors: ( 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 ) / 2 = 6. The next perfect number is
28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14. This is followed by the perfect numbers 496 and 8128. -->
